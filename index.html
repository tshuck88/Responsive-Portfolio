                    <p>Hi there! Welcome to my personal website. Here you will find some information about me and a link to
                        my
                        portfolio. I created this website to showcase some of my web development skills and as place to keep
                        my
                        portfolio updated.
                    </p>
                    <p>I have lived in the Puget Sound region my entire life being born in Federal Way and raised in
                        Woodinville. I currently live in Queen Anne with my girlfriend, Tessa, and dog, Stewart. I graduated
                        from
                        Western Washington University with a BA in Business Administration concentration in Finance and a
                        minor in Economics. I am currently enrolled in UW's Coding Bootcamp to expand my skills and learn
                        web
                        development and to break into the technology field. Click on the portfolio tab at the top to view
                        some
                        of
                        the projects I have worked on in this class.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I'm not coding, I enjoy taking my dog for walks along the Ship Canal Trail on beautiful Seattle
                        summer days, trying new
                        beers from the many different breweries throughout the city, and listening to music and attending
                        live
                        shows.
                        I am an avid sports fan and love attending pretty much any sporting event, but I mostly follow the
                        NFL
                        and
                        NBA. I am also a fantasy football enthusiast and have been playing since I was in middle school.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I hope I was able to give you a glimpse of who I am and what I am about. Feel free to leave your
                        contact
                        information if you would like to reach out or have any questions. Cheers!
                    </p>
